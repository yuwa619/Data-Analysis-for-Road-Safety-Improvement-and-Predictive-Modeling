# Data Analysis for Road Safety Improvement and Predictive Modeling


## Project Background Information

As a data scientist, I'm working with a dataset that includes all road traffic accidents involving casualties in Great Britain. This dataset contains information on non-fatal road traffic accidents, and I'm specifically using the data from 2020.

I have uploaded the relevant data to this repository, and it includes a SQLite database containing the accident data, government guidance on the dataset, and detailed instructions on how to complete accident reporting forms.

## My Task

My role as a data scientist is to analyze this dataset and provide valuable insights to government agencies to enhance road safety. I will perform both exploratory data analysis and modeling to predict accidents and their associated injuries.

### Key Questions

1. Are there significant hours of the day and days of the week when accidents occur?
2. Are there specific patterns for motorbike accidents in terms of hours and days?
3. When do pedestrian accidents predominantly happen?
4. I will utilize the Apriori algorithm to explore the impact of selected variables on accident severity.
5. I will identify and analyze accidents in the region of Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. I will consider clustering to understand the accident distribution.
6. Using outlier detection methods, I will identify unusual entries in the dataset and decide whether to keep them.
7. I will develop a classification model that predicts fatal injuries in road traffic accidents to improve road safety measures.

## My Report

### Introduction

In this project, I am analyzing a dataset containing road traffic accident information to address various aspects of road safety and accident prediction. The dataset includes data from 2020 and presents an opportunity to provide valuable insights to government agencies to enhance road safety measures.

### Analysis

**1. Analysis of Accident Timing**
   - I will explore significant hours of the day and days of the week when accidents occur.

**2. Motorbike Accident Patterns**
   - I will focus on motorbike accidents, especially for different engine sizes (Motorcycle 125cc and under, Motorcycle over 125cc and up to 500cc, and Motorcycle over 500cc), and identify significant hours and days of the week.

**3. Pedestrian Accident Timing**
   - I will analyze pedestrian accidents to determine when they are more likely to occur.

**4. Apriori Algorithm**
   - I will employ the Apriori algorithm to explore the impact of selected variables on accident severity.

**5. Regional Clustering**
   - I will identify and analyze accidents in the Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and East Riding of Yorkshire region. Clustering will be used to reveal insights into the distribution of accidents in this area.

**6. Outlier Detection**
   - I will use outlier detection methods to identify unusual entries in the dataset and make informed decisions regarding their retention.

### Predictions

I will build a predictive model to address the prediction of fatal injuries in road traffic accidents based on the conditions under which they occurred.

### Recommendations

My analysis will provide recommendations for government agencies to improve road safety measures. These recommendations will be summarized into the top 4 or 5 bullet points for clarity and actionability.
